## Features

Stripped down HUD designed to give you the ability to display exactly as much information as you want, at it's most bare only your clip ammo count is shown.

### Useful keybinds have been added to the options menu, including:

- CTap

- Thirdperson (Toggle/Hold)

- Crouch (Toggle)

- Tempus Spray

- Restart Run

- Tempus HUD (Toggle)

- Bounce Check (1 & 2)

- Full Bright (Toggle)

- Show Triggers (Toggle)

- Draw Clip Brushes (Toggle)

### Useful buttons have been added to the pause menu including:

- Toggle HUD Min Mode (Disables health value and centers ammo count)

- Toggle Tempus HUD

- Toggle Tempus Speedo (Horizontal, Vertical, and Absolute)

- Toggle Full Bright

- Toggle Show Triggers

- Toggle Draw Clip Brushes

- Toggle Chat

- Toggle Net Graph


## Customization

Change the speedo colour by editing `speedocolor.cfg` in `jumphud/cfg`.

Use `cl_hud_minmode 1` to hide health value and center ammo count.

## Common Issues:

Tempus HUD elements are stubborn and sometimes reset to their natural colour. Turning the Tempus HUD on and off usually fixes this.
